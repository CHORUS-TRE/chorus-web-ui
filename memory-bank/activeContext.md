## 1. Current Work Focus

**Recent Task Completed: OpenAPI Specification Update Implementation**

A major API update was recently completed where the OpenAPI specification (`apis.swagger.yaml`) was updated, requiring comprehensive changes across all data sources and repositories to handle the new nested response structure.

**Key Changes Implemented:**
- Updated all data sources (`authentication-data-source.ts`, `user-data-source.ts`, `app-data-source.ts`, `workbench-data-source.ts`, `app-instance-data-source.ts`, `workspace-data-source.ts`)
- Updated all repository implementations to handle nested API responses (e.g., `response.result.users` instead of `response.result`)
- Fixed authorization provider mock implementations to resolve TypeScript compilation errors
- Resolved form validation issues in workspace creation forms (`WorkspaceCreateForm`, `PrivateWorkspaceCreateForm`, `WorkspaceUpdateForm`)

**Current Status:**
- All API client implementations are now aligned with the updated OpenAPI specification
- Application builds successfully and tests pass
- Form submission issues resolved through proper default values for validation requirements

**Next Focus: Gatekeeper Authorization Integration**

With the API updates complete, focus returns to implementing the robust authorization layer using the `chorus-gatekeeper` service.

## 2. Recent Changes

- **âœ… OpenAPI API Update Complete (2025-01-28):**
  - Updated all data sources and repositories to handle new nested API response structure
  - Fixed TypeScript compilation errors in authorization provider
  - Resolved workspace form validation issues with `shortName` field requirements
  - Application now successfully builds and all tests pass
- **Workbench k8sStatus Feature Complete:**
  - The feature for polling and displaying workbench status is now considered functionally complete
- **Client-Side OAuth Redirect Complete:**
  - The OAuth redirect flow was refactored to be fully client-side
  - Logic was consolidated from a server-side API route into the `oauthredirect/page.tsx` component

## 3. Next Steps

**Immediate Implementation Plan:**

### Phase 1: Models and Gatekeeper Integration

1. **TODO** - Define Zod schemas for Gatekeeper entities (Permissions, Roles, Policies) in the domain layer.
2. **TODO** - Implement data source and repository for fetching authorization data from the Gatekeeper service.
3. **TODO** - Create use cases for managing authorization state.

**Files to Modify:**

- `src/domain/model/` (new files for authorization)
- `src/data/data-source/` (new gatekeeper data source)
- `src/data/repository/` (new authorization repository)
- `src/domain/use-cases/` (new authorization use cases)

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

- **Gatekeeper Client Source:** The authorization logic will be based on the library provided in `src/lib/gatekeeper`.
- **API Client Desynchronization:** The `k8sStatus` field was manually added to the `ChorusWorkbench.ts` model. The API client should still be regenerated when possible.
