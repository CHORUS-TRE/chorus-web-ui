**Status:** definition

### Business Goals
The primary goal is to understand user engagement and the success rate of critical platform operations. We need to identify friction points in core workflows.

### Key Questions
1. **Workspace Success**: Are users successfully launching workspaces?
2. **Session Success**: Are users successfully launching sessions?
3. **Data Success**: Are users successfully uploading data?
4. **App Success**: Are users successfully launching app instances?
5. **Onboarding Friction**: Where do users drop off during the sign-up process?

### Success Metrics
*   **Workspace Creation Rate**: % of users who start -> complete workspace creation.
*   **Dataset Upload Success**: Count of successful uploads vs failures.
*   **App Launch Rate**: Count of successful app launches.
*   **Sign-up Conversion**: Rate of visitors converting to registered users.

### User Personas
*   **Researchers**: Primary users creating workspaces, uploading data, and running analyses.
*   **Admins**: Managing the platform, likely interested in system-wide usage stats.

### Privacy & Compliance
*   **Standard GDPR**: No extra-strict constraints beyond standard GDPR compliance.
*   **Data Minimization**: Avoid PII in event tracking where possible.
