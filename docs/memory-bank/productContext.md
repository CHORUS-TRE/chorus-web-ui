# Product Context

## 1. The "Why"

Chorus Web UI exists to provide a human-friendly interface to the underlying Chorus platform. While the platform has a powerful API, a dedicated UI is essential for user adoption, ease of use, and abstracting away the complexities of the backend services. It empowers users to manage their cloud-native development environments without needing deep technical knowledge of the underlying infrastructure.

## 2. Problem Solved

The project solves the problem of managing complex, containerized applications in a secure and isolated manner. It provides a "single pane of glass" for users to interact with their digital workspaces, launch applications, and manage their lifecycle.

## 3. User Experience Goals

- **Intuitive:** Users should be able to navigate the application and perform core tasks with minimal guidance.
- **Performant:** The UI should be fast and responsive, providing immediate feedback to user actions.
- **Consistent:** The user interface should be consistent across all pages and components, following a well-defined design system.
- **Informative:** The UI should provide clear status indicators, error messages, and notifications to keep the user informed.
