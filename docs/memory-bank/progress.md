# Progress

## 1. What Works

- A complete, end-to-end data flow pattern for the `App` and `User` entities is fully implemented and documented. This includes the UI dialogs, Server Actions, Use Cases, Repositories, and Data Sources.
- The UI components for creating and editing apps (`AppCreateDialog`, `AppEditDialog`) are robust, providing clear validation, error handling, and user notifications.
- The public-facing `UserRegisterForm` is aligned with the new patterns.
- Initial server-side data fetching for providers is fixed and follows Next.js best practices, preventing client-side rendering errors.
- The core Clean Architecture structure (`domain`, `data`, `presentation`) is proving effective.
- The application's notification system (`useAppState`) is successfully integrated into the data flow.

## 2. What's Left to Build / Refactor

- **Apply Patterns to Other Entities:** The primary task is to refactor the data flows for the remaining entities (`Workspace`, `AppInstance`, `Workbench`, etc.) to match the established patterns.
- **Testing:** Increase test coverage for the new data flow components.
- **User Management UI:** Create a UI for managing users (list, edit, delete) for authenticated admins.

## 3. Current Status

- **Architecture Solidified:** The core data and UI patterns are now defined and validated. The project is ready for broader implementation of these patterns across all features.

## 4. Known Issues

- (None currently identified in the `App` or `User` data flows.)
