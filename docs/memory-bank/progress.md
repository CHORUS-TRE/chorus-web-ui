# Progress

## 1. What Works

- **Complete Role Management System:** Full platform-level role and permission management is implemented and functional:
  - Role matrix UI at `/admin/roles` with permission assignment
  - Recursive role inheritance support in domain models
  - Complete data layer implementation (repositories, data sources, mappers)
  - Integration with user management for role assignment
  - RoleMatrix component for visual permission management
- **Platform-Level User Management:** Full-featured UI for administrators to manage users (create, read, update, delete) with role assignment capabilities.
- **Complete End-to-End Data Flow:** The clean architecture data flow pattern is fully implemented across all entities: `App`, `User`, `AppInstance`, `Workspace`, `Workbench`, and `Role`.
- **Robust UI Components:** Comprehensive UI components for resource management with validation, error handling, and notifications.
- **Public-Facing Registration:** The `UserRegisterForm` is aligned with architectural patterns.
- **Server-Side Data Loading:** Initial server-side data fetching follows Next.js best practices.
- **Effective Core Architecture:** The Clean Architecture structure proves effective across all implemented features.
- **Integrated Notification System:** The notification system is successfully integrated throughout the data flow.
- **Authentication Type System:** All authentication-related TypeScript type errors have been resolved with proper type safety maintained throughout the login flow.
- **✅ Consistent Repository Pattern:** All repository create methods now follow the same pattern - returning the full entity object instead of just an ID.
- **✅ Stable Test Suite:** All tests are passing (61 tests pass, 10 skipped, 11 test suites).
- **✅ Client-Side Authentication:** Authentication flow successfully refactored to client-side with background iframe integration.

## 2. Current Work

### Active Development

- **Workbench k8sStatus Loading State Implementation:** Major feature to implement proper loading states for workbench creation:
  - **Phase 1:** Domain model updates with K8sWorkbenchStatus enum and k8sStatus field
  - **Phase 2:** Polling mechanism with useWorkbenchStatus hook
  - **Phase 3:** UI loading states and background iframe updates
  - **Phase 4:** Error handling and polish
  - **Goal:** Only show background iframe when workbench k8sStatus is "Running"
  - **User Experience:** Prevent users from seeing non-functional sessions with proper loading feedback

### Technical Implementation Status

- **Domain Model Updates:** Not started - need to add k8sStatus field and enum
- **Polling Hook:** Not started - need to create useWorkbenchStatus hook
- **Background Iframe Updates:** Not started - need to add k8sStatus checking
- **Workbench Creation Flow:** Not started - need to add polling until "Running"
- **UI Loading States:** Not started - need to add loading overlays and indicators

### Next Concrete Features

- **Complete k8sStatus Implementation:** All phases of the workbench loading state feature
- **Enhanced Error Handling:** Comprehensive error states for workbench failures
- **Performance Optimization:** Proper cleanup of polling intervals and memory management

### Future Work / On Hold

- **Workspace-Level Role Management:** Team member and role management within specific workspaces is on hold pending workbench status implementation.

### Ongoing Tasks

- **Test Coverage Expansion:** Continue adding tests, especially for the new workbench status polling and loading state features.

## 3. Current Status

- **Major Architecture Milestone:** Role management and client-side authentication demonstrate the maturity and effectiveness of the established architectural patterns.
- **New Feature Development:** Beginning implementation of workbench k8sStatus loading state feature following established patterns.
- **Branch Status:** Working on `feat/k8sstatus` branch for the new workbench loading state functionality.
- **Architecture Proven:** The core data and UI patterns have been successfully applied across all major entities and are ready for the new feature.
- **✅ Test Suite Stability:** All tests are passing consistently.
- **✅ Authentication Complete:** Client-side authentication refactor is complete and stable.

## 4. Known Issues

- **Workbench Loading State:** Currently missing - users may see non-functional sessions before k8sStatus reaches "Running"
- **Background Iframe Premature Display:** The iframe displays immediately after workbench creation, not waiting for "Running" status
- **Mock Role Data:** Role management currently uses placeholder/mock data pending integration with `chorus-gatekeeper` service.

## 5. Recent Fixes

- **Authentication Refactor Complete (2025-01-27):** Successfully moved authentication from server-side to client-side approach:
  - Layout components restructured for authenticated/unauthenticated states
  - Background iframe integration for application hosting
  - All TypeScript type errors resolved
  - Proper error handling and loading states implemented

## 6. Upcoming Implementation

**Workbench k8sStatus Loading State Feature:**
- **Timeline:** Multi-phase implementation following established patterns
- **Impact:** Significant improvement to user experience when creating workbenches
- **Technical Approach:** Clean Architecture patterns with domain models, custom hooks, and UI components
- **Testing Strategy:** Comprehensive testing of polling logic, loading states, and error scenarios
