# Progress

## 1. What Works

- The application has a solid foundation based on Next.js and Clean Architecture principles.
- The separation into `domain`, `data`, and `presentation` layers is established.
- Core features like user authentication and resource listing are partially implemented.
- A UI component library using `shadcn/ui` is in place.
- Development tutorials exist, providing a good starting point for understanding the codebase structure.

## 2. What's Left to Build / Refactor

- **Data Flow Harmonization:** The primary task is to refactor the entire data flow for all entities (`App`, `Workspace`, `AppInstance`, etc.) to be consistent and type-safe.
- **Error Handling:** Implement a robust and user-friendly error handling strategy from the API layer up to the UI.
- **Testing:** Increase test coverage, particularly for use cases and repository implementations.
- **Complete Feature Implementation:** Flesh out all CRUD operations for all application entities.

## 3. Current Status

- **Analysis Phase:** Currently analyzing the existing architecture and identifying areas for improvement.
- **Planning Phase:** In the process of creating a concrete plan for the architectural refactoring.

## 4. Known Issues

- **Linter Errors:** There are TypeScript errors in `src/data/data-source/chorus-api/app-data-source.ts` related to incorrect type mapping between the data source and repository layers. These errors are blocking the path to a stable build.
- **Inconsistent Return Types:** Different layers and functions return inconsistent object shapes (e.g., some return raw API replies, others return a `Result<T>` object, and some return a custom object with `error` or `data` fields). This needs to be standardized.
