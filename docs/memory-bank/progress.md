# Progress

## 1. What Works

- **Workbench k8sStatus Loading State:** The feature is now functionally complete.
  - The UI correctly displays loading states and only shows the session iframe when the workbench is "Running".
  - The backend domain models and polling hook are in place and integrated with the UI.
- **Complete Role Management System:** Full platform-level role and permission management is implemented and functional:
  - Role matrix UI at `/admin/roles` with permission assignment
  - Recursive role inheritance support in domain models
  - Complete data layer implementation (repositories, data sources, mappers)
  - Integration with user management for role assignment
  - RoleMatrix component for visual permission management
- **Platform-Level User Management:** Full-featured UI for administrators to manage users (create, read, update, delete) with role assignment capabilities.
- **Complete End-to-End Data Flow:** The clean architecture data flow pattern is fully implemented across all entities: `App`, `User`, `AppInstance`, `Workspace`, `Workbench`, and `Role`.
- **Robust UI Components:** Comprehensive UI components for resource management with validation, error handling, and notifications.
- **Public-Facing Registration:** The `UserRegisterForm` is aligned with architectural patterns.
- **Server-Side Data Loading:** Initial server-side data fetching follows Next.js best practices.
- **Effective Core Architecture:** The Clean Architecture structure proves effective across all implemented features.
- **Integrated Notification System:** The notification system is successfully integrated throughout the data flow.
- **Authentication Type System:** All authentication-related TypeScript type errors have been resolved with proper type safety maintained throughout the login flow.
- **✅ Consistent Repository Pattern:** All repository create methods now follow the same pattern - returning the full entity object instead of just an ID.
- **✅ Stable Test Suite:** All tests are passing (61 tests pass, 10 skipped, 11 test suites).
- **✅ Client-Side Authentication:** Authentication flow successfully refactored to client-side with background iframe integration.

## 2. Current Work

### Active Development

- **Workbench k8sStatus Loading State Implementation (Phase 4: Polish):**
  - **Goal:** Polish the end-to-end user experience, focusing on graceful error handling and consistent UI feedback.
  - **User Experience:** Ensure that any potential errors (API, timeout, etc.) are communicated clearly to the user.

### Technical Implementation Status

- **Domain Model Updates:** ✅ Done
- **Polling Hook:** ✅ Done
- **Background Iframe Updates:** ✅ Done
- **Workbench Creation Flow:** ✅ Done
- **UI Loading States:** ✅ Done
- **Error Handling & Polish:** In Progress

### Next Concrete Features

- **Enhanced Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error states for workbench failures in the UI.

### Future Work / On Hold

- **Workspace-Level Role Management:** Team member and role management within specific workspaces is on hold pending workbench status implementation.

### Ongoing Tasks

- **Test Coverage Expansion:** Continue adding tests, especially for the new workbench status polling and loading state features.

## 3. Current Status

- **New Feature Complete:** The workbench k8sStatus feature is implemented. Focus is now on refinement.
- **Major Architecture Milestone:** Role management and client-side authentication demonstrate the maturity and effectiveness of the established architectural patterns.
- **Branch Status:** Working on `feat/k8sstatus` branch for the new workbench loading state functionality.
- **Architecture Proven:** The core data and UI patterns have been successfully applied across all major entities and are ready for the new feature.
- **✅ Test Suite Stability:** All tests are passing consistently.
- **✅ Authentication Complete:** Client-side authentication refactor is complete and stable.
- **Background Iframe Premature Display:** Resolved. The iframe now waits for the "Running" status.

## 4. Known Issues

- **API Client Desynchronization:** The `k8sStatus` field was manually added to the generated `ChorusWorkbench.ts` client model. The OpenAPI client should be regenerated to ensure consistency.
- **Workbench Loading State:** The backend work is done, but the UI integration is still in progress. Some parts of the app may not yet reflect the true status of a workbench.
- **Mock Role Data:** Role management currently uses placeholder/mock data pending integration with `chorus-gatekeeper` service.

## 5. Recent Fixes

- **Workbench k8sStatus UI (2025-01-28):** Completed Phase 3 of the workbench status feature, integrating the polling hook and loading states into all relevant UI components.
- **Workbench k8sStatus Backend (2025-01-28):** Completed Phase 1 & 2 of the workbench status feature, including domain model updates and the creation of the `useWorkbenchStatus` polling hook.

## 6. Upcoming Implementation

**Workbench k8sStatus Loading State Feature (Polish):**

- **Timeline:** Finalizing implementation.
- **Impact:** Ensure a robust and polished user experience for the new feature.
- **Technical Approach:** Refine UI components to handle all error states and edge cases gracefully.
- **Testing Strategy:** End-to-end testing of the complete feature, focusing on failure scenarios.
