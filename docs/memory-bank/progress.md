# Progress

## 1. What Works

- **Platform-Level User and Role Management:** A full-featured UI for administrators to manage users (create, read, update, delete) is implemented. This now includes the ability to manage roles via a "permission matrix" and assign those roles to users.
- **Complete End-to-End Data Flow:** The clean architecture data flow pattern for the `App`, `User`, `AppInstance`, `Workspace`, `Workbench`, and now `Role` entities is fully implemented and documented.
- **Robust UI Components:** The UI components for creating and editing resources (`AppCreateDialog`, `AppEditDialog`, `UserCreateDialog`, etc.) are robust, providing clear validation, error handling, and user notifications.
- **Public-Facing Registration:** The public-facing `UserRegisterForm` is aligned with the new patterns.
- **Server-Side Data Loading:** Initial server-side data fetching for providers follows Next.js best practices, preventing client-side rendering errors.
- **Effective Core Architecture:** The core Clean Architecture structure (`domain`, `data`, `presentation`) is proving effective.
- **Integrated Notification System:** The application's notification system (`useAppState`) is successfully integrated into the data flow.

## 2. Next Steps

### Next Concrete Feature
- **Client-Side Authentication Refactor:** The next major task is to refactor the authentication flow. This will involve moving auth state management from server components to client-side hooks and contexts.
- **Background Iframe:** Following the authentication refactor, implement the background iframe to run user application sessions.

### Future Work / On Hold
- **Workspace-Level Role Management:** The feature to manage team members and their roles *within a specific workspace* is on hold pending completion of the authentication and iframe tasks.

### Ongoing Tasks
- **Increase Test Coverage:** Continuously add tests for new and existing data flow components to ensure stability.

## 3. Current Status

- **Pivoting to new feature work:** Having completed the platform-level role management feature, development is now shifting to a major refactor of the authentication system.
- **Architecture Fully Implemented:** The core data and UI patterns have been successfully applied across all major entities. The application is in a consistent and maintainable state.

## 4. Known Issues

- **Using Placeholder Role Definitions:** The role management implementation currently uses mock/placeholder roles and permissions. These need to be replaced by integrating the `chorus-gatekeeper` service.
- **Test Suite Needs Expansion:** While previously fixed, the test suite needs to be expanded to cover the new role management functionality.
