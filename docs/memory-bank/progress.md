# Progress

## 1. What Works

- **User Management UI:** A full-featured UI for administrators to manage users (create, read, update, delete) is now implemented.
- A complete, end-to-end data flow pattern for the `App`, `User`, `AppInstance`, `Workspace`, and `Workbench` entities is fully implemented and documented. This includes the UI dialogs, Server Actions, Use Cases, Repositories, and Data Sources.
- The UI components for creating and editing resources (`AppCreateDialog`, `AppEditDialog`, `WorkspaceForms`, etc.) are robust, providing clear validation, error handling, and user notifications.
- The public-facing `UserRegisterForm` is aligned with the new patterns.
- Initial server-side data fetching for providers is fixed and follows Next.js best practices, preventing client-side rendering errors.
- The core Clean Architecture structure (`domain`, `data`, `presentation`) is proving effective.
- The application's notification system (`useAppState`) is successfully integrated into the data flow.

## 2. Next Steps

### Next Concrete Feature
- **User and Role Management:** The next major feature is to build a comprehensive user and role management interface. This will include:
  - Adding role assignment capabilities to the platform-level user administration page.
  - Creating a new view for managing team members and their roles within a specific workspace.
  - Establishing the necessary data models and layers to support roles and permissions.

### Ongoing Tasks
- **Increase Test Coverage:** Continuously add tests for new and existing data flow components to ensure stability.

## 3. Current Status

- **Architecture Fully Implemented:** The core data and UI patterns have been successfully applied across all major entities. The application is in a consistent and maintainable state.
- **Actively developing User and Role Management feature:** Work is now underway to build the platform and workspace level interfaces for managing roles and user assignments.

## 4. Known Issues

- **Test Suite was Failing (now fixed):** Running `pnpm test` produced multiple errors that have now been addressed.
- **Missing Role Definitions:** The implementation will proceed with placeholder roles, as the definitive list from the `chorus-gatekeeper` service is not yet integrated.
- (None currently identified in the `App`, `User`, `AppInstance`, `Workspace`, or `Workbench` data flows.)
