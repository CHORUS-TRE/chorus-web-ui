# Progress

## 1. What Works

- **Complete Role Management System:** Full platform-level role and permission management is implemented and functional:
  - Role matrix UI at `/admin/roles` with permission assignment
  - Recursive role inheritance support in domain models
  - Complete data layer implementation (repositories, data sources, mappers)
  - Integration with user management for role assignment
  - RoleMatrix component for visual permission management
- **Platform-Level User Management:** Full-featured UI for administrators to manage users (create, read, update, delete) with role assignment capabilities.
- **Complete End-to-End Data Flow:** The clean architecture data flow pattern is fully implemented across all entities: `App`, `User`, `AppInstance`, `Workspace`, `Workbench`, and `Role`.
- **Robust UI Components:** Comprehensive UI components for resource management with validation, error handling, and notifications.
- **Public-Facing Registration:** The `UserRegisterForm` is aligned with architectural patterns.
- **Server-Side Data Loading:** Initial server-side data fetching follows Next.js best practices.
- **Effective Core Architecture:** The Clean Architecture structure proves effective across all implemented features.
- **Integrated Notification System:** The notification system is successfully integrated throughout the data flow.
- **Authentication Type System:** All authentication-related TypeScript type errors have been resolved with proper type safety maintained throughout the login flow.
- **✅ Consistent Repository Pattern:** All repository create methods now follow the same pattern - returning the full entity object instead of just an ID.
- **✅ Stable Test Suite:** All tests are passing (61 tests pass, 10 skipped, 11 test suites).

## 2. Current Work

### Active Development

- **Authentication Refactor:** Major refactoring of authentication from server-side to client-side approach is in progress:
  - Layout components restructured for authenticated/unauthenticated states
  - Authentication middleware removed
  - Background iframe integration for application hosting
  - Login and registration flows updated
  - **✅ COMPLETED:** All authentication TypeScript type errors resolved with proper type safety
  - **✅ COMPLETED:** Repository pattern consistency fixed - UserRepository now returns full User objects

### Next Concrete Features

- **Complete Authentication Refactor:** Finalize the client-side authentication implementation
- **Background Iframe Functionality:** Complete the application hosting infrastructure
- **End-to-End Testing:** Validate the new authentication flow

### Future Work / On Hold

- **Workspace-Level Role Management:** Team member and role management within specific workspaces is on hold pending authentication completion.

### Ongoing Tasks

- **Test Coverage Expansion:** Continue adding tests, especially for the new role management and authentication features.

## 3. Current Status

- **Major Architecture Milestone:** Role management implementation demonstrates the maturity and effectiveness of the established architectural patterns.
- **Authentication Transition:** Currently in the middle of a significant authentication architecture refactor.
- **Branch Status:** Working on `feat/roles-management` branch which contains both completed role work and ongoing authentication changes.
- **Architecture Proven:** The core data and UI patterns have been successfully applied across all major entities.
- **✅ Test Suite Stability:** All tests are now passing consistently.

## 4. Known Issues

- **Authentication Transition:** Some instability expected during the ongoing authentication refactor (type system issues resolved).
- **Mock Role Data:** Role management currently uses placeholder/mock data pending integration with `chorus-gatekeeper` service.
- **Branch Consolidation:** The current branch contains both completed and in-progress work that may need separation.

## 5. Recent Fixes

- **Repository Pattern Consistency (2025-01-27):** Fixed inconsistency in UserRepository where the create method was returning only a string ID instead of the full User object. This change:
  - Made UserRepository consistent with all other repositories (App, Workspace, Workbench, etc.)
  - Fixed failing test in `__tests__/use-cases/user-api.test.ts`
  - Improved API consistency across the entire codebase
