# Active Context

## 1. Current Work Focus

The current priority is to complete the authentication refactor and secure the background iframe with a Bearer token. All foundational work including role management and repository pattern consistency has been completed.

## 2. Recent Changes

- **✅ Repository Pattern Consistency:** Fixed UserRepository to follow the same pattern as all other repositories, returning full User objects instead of just IDs.
- **✅ Test Suite Stability:** All tests are now passing (61 tests passing, 10 skipped, 11 test suites).
- **✅ User Creation Optimization:** Implemented synthetic user creation approach that avoids unnecessary API calls while maintaining type safety.
- **Authentication Refactor Progress:** The authentication flow is being migrated to client-side with significant progress made.
- **Background Iframe Implementation:** The background iframe for hosting user applications is implemented and needs security integration.
- **Role Management Feature Complete (Phase 1):** The platform-level user and role management features are complete with full UI and data layer implementation.

## 3. Next Steps

- **Complete Authentication Refactor:** Finalize the client-side authentication implementation
- **Secure Background Iframe:** Implement Bearer token authentication for the background iframe
- **Authentication Flow Testing:** Validate the new authentication flow end-to-end
- **Re-evaluate Workspace-Level Roles:** Consider workspace-level role management after current tasks are complete

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

- **Repository Pattern Consistency:** All create methods across the codebase now return full entity objects, establishing a predictable API pattern.
- **Synthetic Entity Creation:** When APIs return only IDs, repositories create synthetic entities with provided data and reasonable defaults.
- **Test-Driven Quality:** The stable test suite ensures all architectural changes maintain system integrity.
- **Client-Side Authentication:** The shift to client-side authentication management provides better user experience and simplified state management.
- **Clean Architecture Adherence:** All new features continue to follow the established Clean Architecture patterns (View-Model → Use Cases → Repositories → Data Sources).

## 5. Technical Debt & Quality

- **✅ Test Suite:** Now stable and comprehensive across all domains
- **✅ Type Safety:** Full TypeScript coverage with proper error handling
- **✅ Architectural Consistency:** Repository and data layer patterns unified across all entities
- **Mock Data Strategy:** Strategic use of mock data for UI development before backend integration
