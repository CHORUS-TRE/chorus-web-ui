# Active Context

## 1. Current Work Focus

The immediate priority is to diagnose and fix the failing tests in the existing test suite. The goal is to get the `pnpm test` command to pass successfully, ensuring the codebase is stable before proceeding with new feature development.

## 2. Recent Changes

- **User Management UI Implemented:** A complete UI for administrators to create, view, update, and delete users has been added.
- **Data Flow Refactoring Complete:** The `Workspace` and `Workbench` entities were refactored, completing the architectural overhaul for all major entities.
- **Architectural Rules Clarified:** The usage of Server Actions vs. client-side fetching has been clarified in `.cursorrules` and `systemPatterns.md`.
- **Memory Bank Updated:** A full review and update of the memory bank has been completed to ensure all documentation is current and consistent.

## 3. Next Steps

- Execute `pnpm test` to get a baseline of failing tests.
- Systematically fix each failing test.
- Once the test suite is stable, await direction on the next major feature.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

- The core architectural patterns (Clean Architecture, Repository/Data Source, Mappers) are stable and must be followed for any new feature development.
- The distinction between client-side fetching (default) and Server Actions (for forms) is a key pattern to maintain.
