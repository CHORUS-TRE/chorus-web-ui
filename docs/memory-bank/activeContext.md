# Active Context

## 1. Current Focus

The current focus is on analyzing and harmonizing the data architecture of the Chorus Web UI application. The goal is to establish a consistent, robust, and easily understandable pattern for data fetching, mutation, and state management across all features.

## 2. Recent Changes

- Initiated a discussion about the existing Clean Architecture implementation.
- Identified inconsistencies in the data flow, particularly with the `App` entity's `create` and `update` operations, leading to TypeScript errors.
- Began the process of documenting the intended architectural patterns in the Memory Bank.

## 3. Next Steps

- **Finalize Architectural Blueprint:** Answer the clarifying questions posed by the AI assistant to solidify the target architectural pattern for data handling.
- **Create Refactoring Plan:** Develop a detailed, step-by-step plan to refactor the existing codebase to align with the new architectural blueprint.
- **Implement a Pilot Refactor:** Apply the plan to the `App` entity's data flow as a proof-of-concept. This will serve as a template for other entities.
- **Document the Process:** Create reproducible documentation from the refactoring process.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

- **Standardizing the `Result<T>` Object:** Deciding where in the data flow the transformation from raw API responses to the application's standard `Result<T>` object should occur. The current hypothesis is that this is the responsibility of the Repository Implementation layer.
- **Enforcing Architectural Boundaries:** Ensuring that UI components only interact with Server Actions, and that layers only communicate with their adjacent layers as defined in the system architecture.
