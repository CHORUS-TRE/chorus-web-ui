# Active Context

## 1. Current Work Focus

The current priority is to build a comprehensive user and role management interface. This involves creating views at both the platform and workspace level to manage users, roles, and their associated permissions, based on the provided UI mockups and requirements.

## 2. Recent Changes

- **User Management UI Implemented:** A complete UI for administrators to create, view, update, and delete users has been added.
- **Data Flow Refactoring Complete:** The `Workspace` and `Workbench` entities were refactored, completing the architectural overhaul for all major entities.
- **Architectural Rules Clarified:** The usage of Server Actions vs. client-side fetching has been clarified in `.cursorrules` and `systemPatterns.md`.
- **Memory Bank Updated:** A full review and update of the memory bank has been completed to ensure all documentation is current and consistent.

## 3. Next Steps

- Define data models for `Role` and `Permission`.
- Implement mock data layers for roles and permissions for UI development.
- Build the platform-level role management UI (the "permission matrix").
- Integrate role assignment into the existing platform-level user management UI.
- Build the workspace-level user and role management view.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

- The implementation will proceed with placeholder roles and permissions, as the definitive list from the `chorus-gatekeeper` service is not yet integrated.
- The core architectural patterns (Clean Architecture, Repository/Data Source, Mappers) are stable and must be followed for any new feature development.
- The distinction between client-side fetching (default) and Server Actions (for forms) is a key pattern to maintain.
