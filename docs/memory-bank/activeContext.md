# Active Context

## 1. Current Work Focus

The documentation in the Memory Bank has been reviewed and updated. The project is now poised to begin the next phase of feature development, building upon the recently stabilized architectural patterns.

## 2. Recent Changes

- **Data Flow Refactoring Complete:** The `Workspace` and `Workbench` entities were refactored, completing the architectural overhaul for all major entities.
- **Architectural Rules Clarified:** The usage of Server Actions vs. client-side fetching has been clarified in `.cursorrules` and `systemPatterns.md`.
- **Memory Bank Updated:** A full review and update of the memory bank has been completed to ensure all documentation is current and consistent.

## 3. Next Steps

- The next development task is to implement the **User Management UI**, which is a key feature outlined in the `progress.md` file.
- A potential future task that was mentioned is to create all the data flows in `apis.swagger.yaml`.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

- The core architectural patterns (Clean Architecture, Repository/Data Source, Mappers) are stable and must be followed for any new feature development.
- The distinction between client-side fetching (default) and Server Actions (for forms) is a key pattern to maintain.
