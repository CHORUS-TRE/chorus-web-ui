## 1. Current Work Focus

**Primary Task: Implement Workbench k8sStatus Loading State (Phase 4: Polish)**

With the core implementation of the workbench k8sStatus feature complete, the current priority is to polish the error handling and user experience. This involves ensuring that all edge cases, such as polling timeouts and API errors, are handled gracefully in the UI.

**Key Requirements:**
- Provide clear, user-friendly error messages for all failure scenarios.
- Implement and test timeout handling.
- Ensure a smooth and consistent user experience across all related components.

## 2. Recent Changes

- **Workbench k8sStatus UI (Phase 3) Complete:**
  - The `background-iframe.tsx` component now correctly uses the `useWorkbenchStatus` hook, displaying a loading overlay while polling and only showing the iframe when the workbench is "Running".
  - All UI components related to the workbench lifecycle have been updated to reflect the k8sStatus.
- **Workbench k8sStatus Backend (Phase 1 & 2) Complete:**
  - The domain model for `Workbench` has been updated to include the `k8sStatus` field and a `K8sWorkbenchStatus` enum.
  - A new `useWorkbenchStatus` hook has been created to handle polling for the workbench status.
  - The `getWorkbench` action was added to support the new hook.

## 3. Next Steps

**Immediate Implementation Plan:**

### Phase 4: Error Handling & Polish (In Progress)
1.  **TODO** - Handle polling errors gracefully in all affected components (`workbench-create-form`, `workbench-table`, `background-iframe`).
2.  **TODO** - Add user-friendly timeout error messages after 5 minutes of polling.
3.  **TODO** - Conduct a final review of the end-to-end user flow for polish and consistency.

**Files to Modify:**
- `src/components/forms/workbench-create-form.tsx`
- `src/components/workbench-table.tsx`
- `src/app/(workspaces)/workspaces/[workspaceId]/sessions/[sessionId]/page.tsx`
- `src/components/background-iframe.tsx`

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

- **API Client:** The `k8sStatus` field was manually added to the `ChorusWorkbench.ts` model as a temporary measure. The API client should be regenerated to formally include this change.
- **Error State Design:** Error messages should be consistent and provide clear guidance to the user where possible.
